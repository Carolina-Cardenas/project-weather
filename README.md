# Weather App

This assignment was done by Carolina CÃ¡rdenas and Samrachna Adhikari, and we chose to go with the second desogn that was provided. The app displays current weather of set city, the temperature, sunrise, and sunset, here we have chosen Knivsta as our city.

## The problem

Once we had the html and css files ready, we decided to split one feature each for either of us. Carolina worked on the Weather Forecast feature where the weather for the next 5 days is shown and Samrachna worked on the Sunrise and sunset feature. We had issues on displaying the time in the correct format but after reading a the mdn documentations, and reading some articles on how to do it we were able to use the newDate method.
